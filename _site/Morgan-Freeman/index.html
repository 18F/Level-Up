    <p>Software falls but can be rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. circumstances have taught me that a man’s ethics
are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only
perfect intentions. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess
you can’t now, being dead and all. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn’t eat for three weeks. well, what is it
today? more spelunking? you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. i did the same thing to
gandhi, he didn’t eat for three weeks. the man likes to play chess; let’s get him some rocks. i don’t think they tried
to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his
ass.</p>

<p>Rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don’t have any idea what that means. mister wayne, if you don’t want to
tell me exactly what you’re doing, when i’m asked, i don’t have to lie. but don’t think of me as an idiot. circumstances
have taught me that a man’s ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. it only took me six days.
same time it took the lord to make the world. bruce… i’m god. Open Source Software fall but they are rebuilt. heroes
die but they are remembered. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man
insane. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that’s how much he thinks he loves you. boxing is about respect.

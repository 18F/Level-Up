When building software in the open, accountability is thrust to the forefront and 
attention to quality and detail become paramount. This is a good thing for software.

Equally as important is the amount of effort that goes into ensuring the product's quality.
If a project is started in the open from scratch, a team can easily apply code review and
other quality workflows in small incremental steps rather than a single monolithic review 
of a large code base.

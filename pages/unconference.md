----------------------------------------
- **Approaching challenging people with compassion** 
	- We frequently interact with people who can frustrate or block us. They may be impediments to us making progress or people who have untapped potential. I'd like to run an exercise aimed at understanding what's driving the person to act the way they do, followed by a discussion of how we can make that person an ally. 
	- Topic: Client Engagement
	- Host: Ed Mullen 
	- [LU-Room-1](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/lu-room-1?hceid=Z3NhLmdvdl9vc2c0cmo0YmRtNnZzMmh0cWkyOXFrMDAwb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t.i8r5893mc97pjehqgm65c2ask0&authuser=0)

- **Email Marketing: A Tool for Grand Dissemination and Transactional Opportunities** 
	- How do we best maximize our communication channels? USAGov boasts a near 800,000 email subscribers. Right now, we send information that is timely, partner with other federal agencies on promotional efforts, and use it to market our products and services. How can we capitalize on this vehicle to improve customer experience with the government?

- **FULL: How to get your clients to love you: critical skills for humans who consult**

- **Hacking Humans: An Engineer's Guide to Effecting Cultural Change**
	- Many of us with largely technical background may feel uncertain when our work involves challenging assumptions or guiding clients to new ways of thinking. What works and what doesn't? And how do we get better at this valuable skill?  This is a  (http://leancoffee.org) session, so we'll take 5-10 minutes to learn Lean Coffee (a great technique for democratized meetings), and then dive in to the topics you want to share or explore.

- **Who is Travis? Basics of CI/CD and how to diagnose build errors, for content writers!**
	- If you make GitHub pull requests for text changes and aren't primarily an engineer, you might have run into a failed Travis/Concourse/CircleCI/Wercker check on your PRs and asked for help to figure out what went wrong. But it turns out you can fix a lot of build errors yourself with a little bit of deciphering! Let's talk about the basics of what continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) means and how these services work, and then let's look at a few examples of error messages from failed builds to share knowledge about how to self-diagnose and fix common build errors. Optional: bring a link to a pull request with a failed build, so we can discuss it! (This is primarily for people who write content and don't have engineering as one of their primary skills, but everyone is welcome.)

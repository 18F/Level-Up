## Sessions: 
- **Approaching challenging people with compassion** 
	- We frequently interact with people who can frustrate or block us. They may be impediments to us making progress or people who have untapped potential. I'd like to run an exercise aimed at understanding what's driving the person to act the way they do, followed by a discussion of how we can make that person an ally. 
	- Host: Ed Mullen 
	- [LU-Room-1](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/lu-room-1?hceid=Z3NhLmdvdl9vc2c0cmo0YmRtNnZzMmh0cWkyOXFrMDAwb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t.i8r5893mc97pjehqgm65c2ask0&authuser=0)

- **Email Marketing: A Tool for Grand Dissemination and Transactional Opportunities** 
	- How do we best maximize our communication channels? USAGov boasts a near 800,000 email subscribers. Right now, we sent information that is timely, partner with other federal agencies on promotional efforts, and use it to market our products and services. How can we capitalize on this vehicle to improve customer experience with the government?

- **How to get your clients to love you: critical skills for humans who consult**
	- You're an expensive outsider asking people under serious pressure to change their core habits, and often telling them things they were hoping not to hear. This can be a win-win. Let's talk about how.
	- Host: Cyd Harrell
	- [LU-Room-3](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/lu-room-3?hceid=Z3NhLmdvdl9vc2c0cmo0YmRtNnZzMmh0cWkyOXFrMDAwb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t.lqolm510qb8473mmoi20gcj5k8&authuser=0)

- **How should we manage our products?**
	- Let's think about how we manage products (small and large) and what we can do better in the future. This would be less a presentation and more a discussion/brainstorm/ideation session.
	- Host: Will Slack

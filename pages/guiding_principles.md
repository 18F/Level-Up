#### We believe

- Distributing OSS[^1] helps to foster public trust 
- Collaborating on OSS projects creates higher quality software and _directly_ 
  serves the public at large  
- OSS can be very cost-effective as it bypasses the need to procure software licenses
- OSS focuses on learning and developing skills rather than on procurement

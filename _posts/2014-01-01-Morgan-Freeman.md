Software falls but can be rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. I once heard a wise man say there are is perfect software. Only
perfect intentions. No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. But i guess you can't now, being dead and all. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. Well, what is it today? more spelunking? you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his
ass.

Multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. Open Source Software fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks.

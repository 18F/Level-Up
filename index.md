Level Up — a fully distributed, half-day, peer-to-peer learning event: Friday, January 27 from 1 - 5p ET. Like 18F’s IRL before it, Level Up will be a great opportunity to get to know and learn from each other. Unlike IRL, we’re doing it over video--and we’re inviting all of TTS. We’re also bringing fresh focus to helping each other gain knowledge and skills that will advance our collective work (thus the new name).  

Here is how the half-day will go:

- 1:00 - 1:15 pm: All-team opening session. Join this session using the YouTube live link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl5T-VQOw8E)
- 1:15 - 1:20 pm: Transition
- 1:20 - 2:30 pm: [Unconference sessions]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/unconference.html) — staff-led discussions in groups of 10 - 15; you’ll suggest the topics, but broadly, we expect sessions will fall into categories like working productively in government, managing people well, and boosting technical/agile skills
- 2:30 - 2:40 pm: Transition 
- 2:40 - 3:40 pm: [Snack break]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/breakout.html) with assigned “tables” where you’ll have a chance to meet team members from around TTS. Bring a snack to enjoy!
- 3:40 - 3:45 pm: Transition
- 3:45 - 4:45 pm:[Lessons learned sessions]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/lessons.html) — staff-led discussions in groups of 10 - 15; again, you’ll suggest the topics, but we’re looking for stories of failure or wild success that others can learn from
- 4:45 - 5:00 pm: All-team closing session. Join this session using the YouTube live link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl5T-VQOw8E)
